# Progressive Marker Loading Implementation

## Overview
Implemented progressive loading for food outlet markers to improve performance when handling large datasets (>500 markers).

## Key Features

### 1. **Configuration**
```javascript
const PROGRESSIVE_LOADING_CONFIG = {
  THRESHOLD: 500,        // Start progressive loading if more than 500 markers
  CHUNK_SIZE: 100,       // Load 100 markers at a time
  CHUNK_DELAY: 50        // 50ms delay between chunks
};
```

### 2. **Smart Loading Strategy**
- **Small datasets (<500 markers)**: Loads all markers immediately for instant rendering
- **Large datasets (≥500 markers)**: Loads markers in chunks of 100 with 50ms delays between chunks

### 3. **Visual Feedback**
When progressive loading is active, users see:
- A floating progress indicator at the top of the map
- Real-time progress percentage
- Animated progress bar showing completion status
- Spinner animation to indicate active loading

### 4. **Performance Benefits**
- **Prevents UI freezing**: By breaking marker rendering into smaller chunks
- **Maintains responsiveness**: Users can interact with already-loaded markers while others load
- **Smooth experience**: 50ms delays between chunks keep the UI responsive
- **Memory efficient**: Proper cleanup of timeouts prevents memory leaks

### 5. **Implementation Details**

#### State Management
```javascript
const loadingTimeoutsRef = useRef([]);
const [markerLoadProgress, setMarkerLoadProgress] = useState(0);
const [isLoadingMarkers, setIsLoadingMarkers] = useState(false);
```

#### Loading Function
- Creates marker chunks based on CHUNK_SIZE
- Schedules chunk rendering with setTimeout
- Tracks progress and updates UI
- Cleans up timeouts on component unmount or re-render

#### Cleanup
- Clears pending timeouts when component unmounts, city changes, or new data loads
- Prevents memory leaks and ensures clean state

### 6. **Edge Cases Handled**
- Component unmounts during loading → timeouts cleared
- User switches cities → previous loading canceled, new loading starts
- Data updates during loading → loading restarted with new data
- Small datasets → bypasses progressive loading for instant render

## Testing Recommendations

1. Small dataset (< 500 markers): Should load instantly without progress indicator
2. Large dataset (≥ 500 markers): Should show progress indicator with smooth animations
3. Rapid city switching: Previous loading should cancel cleanly

## Configuration Tuning

Adjust these values based on your needs:
- **THRESHOLD**: Lower for slower devices, higher for faster devices
- **CHUNK_SIZE**: Smaller chunks = more frequent updates but more overhead
- **CHUNK_DELAY**: Longer delays = more responsive during loading
